# This folder contains the following homeworks:
  # 1. RGB_CONTROLLER (lab 2 homework) 
    a circuit with three potentiometers controling the 3 pins of an rgb led so I can control each color
    independently of the others.
  # 2. KNOCK_DETECTOR (lab 3 homework) 
    a circuit which uses a passive buzzer to detect knocks on the table (or more likely on itself) and       
    waits 5 seconds before triggering an active buzzer which can be stoped by pressing a button.
