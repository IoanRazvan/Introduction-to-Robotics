# This folder contains the following homeworks:
  # 1. RGB_CONTROLLER 
    Homework for the second laboratory which consists of a circuit with three potentiometers controling the 3 pins 
    of an rgb led so I can control each color independently of the others.
  # 2. KNOCK_DETECTOR
    Third laboratory homework - a circuit which uses a passive buzzer to detect knocks on the table (or more likely on itself) 
    and waits 5 seconds before triggering an active buzzer which can be stoped by pressing a button.
  # 3. JOYSTICK_CONTROLED_4_DIGITS_7_SEGMENT
    Fourth laboratory homework - a circuit through which you can control a 4 digits 7-segment display with a joystick. If no digit is selected the decimal point of the digit currently positioned on is blinking, in this state you can switch between digits by moving the joystick on the X axis. 
    When pressing down on the joystick you select a particular digit you want to increment or decrement by moving the joystick on the Y axis. Pressing down a second time will get you back to selecting a particular digit.
  # 4. LCD MENU
    For this homework, I have created a joystick controled menu which is 
    displayed on an LCD. The menu has 3 options: Start, Settings and Highscore. This option are accesed by pressing the button of the joystick.
    Start - displays information about an ongoing game.
    Settings - lets the user modify some parameters such as the starting level            of a game
    Highscore - displays information about the current highscore and it's holder
